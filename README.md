## Introduction
This project, **Image Caption and Story Generator**, utilizes deep learning techniques to generate meaningful captions and short stories based on the content of input images. The application processes an image, generates a caption describing the objects and activities within, and extends the caption into a more elaborate story.

## Features
- **Image Captioning**: Automatically generates captions for images using trained deep learning models.
- **Story Generation**: Extends the image captions into a coherent story.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily upload images and get captions or stories through a simple interface.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art models like Transformer or GPT-2 to provide accurate and detailed descriptions.
  
## Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Required Python libraries: see `requirements.txt`

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/priyans877/Image-Caption-Story-generatot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Image-Caption-Story-generatot
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Input
- Upload any image from your local machine.
  
### Output
- The application will generate a caption and a story based on the uploaded image.

## Technologies Used
